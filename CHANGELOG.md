# Changelog

## [1.6.2] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `herd link` in `mount` now runs with an explicit `cd` into the worktree root before calling `herd link`, matching the pattern used in `unmount`. Previously, `herd link` was called from the caller's `pwd`, which caused the Herd symlink to point to the wrong directory when the shell's working directory differed from the worktree root.
- Replaced `-V` short flag for `--version` with `-v` for consistency.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Show spinner during `herd link` on mount for visual feedback while nginx reloads
- Abort mount with hard error if `herd link` fails instead of silently continuing
- Replace manual `ln -sfn` symlink on unmount with `herd link` to trigger Herd nginx reload and fix 404s after unmount
- Warn instead of silently swallowing errors from `herd unlink` fallback on unmount

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Spinners for long-running steps** — WP core download/extract, `composer install`, package manager install, and package manager build now show a braille spinner (`⠋⠙⠹…`) while running in the background. On failure, the last 5 lines of output are printed to aid debugging.

### Changed
- `wait_for_herd` in unmount moved to after all cleanup steps, mirroring mount's pattern — Herd's nginx config reload now happens in the background during teardown rather than blocking it.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Domain availability check** — after `herd link` (mount) and `herd unlink` (unmount), wt-link polls both `http://` and `https://` with a braille spinner until the domain responds or a 10s timeout is reached. Any non-zero HTTP response counts as live; a warning is shown on timeout.

### Changed
- **Herd link moved to step 1 of mount** — the domain is now registered with Herd at the very beginning of mount so Herd's nginx config reloads in the background while WP core, composer deps, node_modules, and the asset build run. The domain poll at the end acts as a verification gate and typically returns immediately.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Global mount registry** — a per-site registry file (`~/.config/wt-link/<site>.active`) now tracks which worktree currently owns the Herd link. This prevents two worktrees silently competing for the same `.test` domain.
- **Mount ownership check** — mounting a worktree when another worktree already owns the domain warns the user and exits. Pass `--force` / `-f` to override and steal the link.
- **Registry in `status`** — `wt-link status` now shows the registry canonical path and active owner alongside local state.

### Changed
- Herd link restore target is now stored in the global registry (`canonical=`) instead of the per-worktree state file (`herd_previous_target`). Unmount reads the registry to restore the canonical site; per-worktree state no longer needs to track this.
- **Code organisation** — section headers renamed to consistent `UPPER CASE`; `Helpers` split into `OUTPUT` and `PREREQUISITES`; `WP_CORE_MARKER`, `STATE FILE`, and `GLOBAL REGISTRY` merged into a single `STATE & REGISTRY` block.

## [1.3.4] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Herd link restore on fresh mount** — when no pre-existing Herd link existed at mount time, `unmount` would run `herd unlink` leaving `site.test` unresolved. Mount now records the canonical site as the restore target; unmount falls back to re-linking canonical when no saved target is present.
- **Re-mount clobbers restore target** — mounting the same worktree twice would overwrite `herd_previous_target` with the worktree path itself, causing unmount to restore to the wrong location. The target is now written only once (first mount wins).
- **`node_modules/` left behind after unmount** — `pm install` creates a real directory, not a symlink. Unmount now removes it unconditionally with `rm -rf`.
- **`public/` not cleaned on unmount** — mount now always runs `pm build` and tracks `public_built_<pkg>` in state; unmount removes the built `public/` directory when that key is present. The previous rsync copy-from-canonical fallback is removed.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Package manager detection now recognises `bun.lock`** — Bun's text-format lockfile (`bun.lock`) is now detected alongside the legacy binary `bun.lockb`. Projects without either lockfile now default to `bun` instead of `npm`.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`vendor-prefixed/` not symlinked** — mount/unmount were using `vendor_prefixed` (underscore) but Eightshift projects always use `vendor-prefixed` (hyphen, Strauss default). The prefixed-vendor symlink was silently skipped on every mount.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Subdirectory invocation** — `mount`, `unmount`, and `status` now traverse up from the current directory to find `setup.json`, stopping at the git repo root. Previously, the commands only worked when invoked from the exact worktree root.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Package manager auto-detection** — `bun` is no longer required globally. `mount` now detects the package manager per Eightshift package by inspecting lockfiles in priority order: `bun.lockb` → `yarn.lock` → `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `package-lock.json` → `package.json` `.packageManager` field → fallback `npm`.
- **Composer deps symlinked from canonical** — `vendor/` and `vendor-prefixed/` are now symlinked from the canonical site instead of running `composer install` (falls back to `composer install` if the canonical has no `vendor/`).
- **`node_modules` always rebuilt** — `bun install` (or the detected PM) now always runs; the "already installed" skip is removed.
- **`status` shows detected PM** — each Eightshift package line now includes `pm:<name>`.
- **`unmount` cleans vendor symlinks** — `vendor/` and `vendor-prefixed/` symlinks are now removed on unmount.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Composer deps symlinked** — `vendor/` and `vendor-prefixed/` are symlinked from the canonical site's equivalent package; `composer install` is only run as a fallback.
- **`node_modules` always rebuilt** — removed the skip-if-present check; `bun install` always runs.
- **`unmount` removes vendor symlinks** — added cleanup of `vendor/` and `vendor-prefixed/` symlinks.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-09

### Changed
- `node_modules` is now rebuilt via `bun install` instead of being symlinked from the canonical site, giving each worktree independent JS deps.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-09

Initial release.
